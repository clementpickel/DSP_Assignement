    "# Exercise 7: Data Transformation with dplyr & lubridate\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook contains exercises on data transformation. We're following [Chapter 5 in _R for Data Science_](https://r4ds.had.co.nz/transform.html), but also jump ahead a bit and include [Chapter 16 on \"dates and times\"](https://r4ds.had.co.nz/dates-and-times.html).\n",
    "\n",
    "Concretely, we'll look at the five core functions for data manipulation with dplyr – `filter()`, `arrange()`, `select()`, `mutate()`, and `summarise()` –, data grouping via `group_by()`, how to use pipes to chain function calls via `%>%`, and how to work with dates, date-times, and times-of-day.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Learning Goals\n",
    "\n",
    "- Know how to _perform data manipulation_ with dplyr.\n",
    "- Understand how to _use pipes_.\n",
    "- Understand how to _work with dates and date-times_ in lubridate, and _time-of-day_ in hms.\n",
