    "\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook contains exercises on data visualization using the Seaborn library. In particular, we'll focus on _exploratory data analysis:_ trying to understand your dataset better by producing plots. This exercise focuses on what different plot types there are, how to use them, and what they mean.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Learning Goals\n",
    "\n",
    "- Understand how to produce plots with the help of the Seaborn API.\n",
    "- Know how to _find the right Seaborn functions_ for a given plot type.\n",
    "- Know how to _interpret common plot types_ provided by Seaborn.\n",
