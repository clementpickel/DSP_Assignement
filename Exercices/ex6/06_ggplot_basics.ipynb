    "\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook contains exercises on getting started with data visualization using R and ggplot2. We're following [Chapter 3 in _R for Data Science_](https://r4ds.had.co.nz/data-visualisation.html) **(when I refer to \"the book\", I always mean this one!)**, except that we'll turn to datasets that we have seen before in the Python exercises. The book jumps right into data exploration by making visualizations: don't worry if you don't understand every basic language feature of R yet, we'll practice some of those later as we need them. Our focus is the same as the book's: getting started with producing some useful output quickly, and learning more as we go.\n",
