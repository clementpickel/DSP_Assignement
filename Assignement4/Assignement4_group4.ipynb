    "In this assignment, you need to work in the same groups you already are divided into. Now you need to do what you have done before in Assignments 1, 2 and 3, but in a different language. You have to apply the tasks on the dataset that you used in Assignment 1, 2, and 3. \n",

    "You will hand in the assignment through a Jupyter notebook, along with your environment and the dataset you picked, both zipped together and submitted as one file. Please name your file so that it contains your group number. It is important that you clearly state the tasks you are performing on the dataset as questions or something similar in the notebook before you do the operations on the data. Also make sure to document your solutions and your thinking so that it can easily be followed. If you fail to do these things, you may not pass this assignment.\n",
